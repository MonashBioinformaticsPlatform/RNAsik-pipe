  abstract = "New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for analyzing
              read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method estimates
              the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a
              precision weight for each observation and enters these into the
              limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for
              RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for
              microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well
              or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are
              generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods.

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate
                 millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to
                 a reference genome. In many applications, the key information
                 required for downstream analysis is the number of reads
                 mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or
                 each gene. The process of counting reads is called read
                 summarization. Read summarization is required for a great
                 variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively
                 little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present
                 featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for
                 counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA
                 sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly
                 efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques.
                 It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order
                 of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far
                 less computer memory. It works with either single or
                 paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options
                 appropriate for different sequencing applications.
                 AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: featureCounts is available
