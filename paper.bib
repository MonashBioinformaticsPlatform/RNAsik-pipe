                 is a crucial step of a robust pipeline for processing
                 high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. Bioinformatics software
                 tools capable of performing this task are available, either
                 for general analysis of HTS data or targeted to a specific
                 sequencing technology. However, most of the existing QC
                 instruments only allow processing of one sample at a time.
                 RESULTS: Qualimap 2 represents a next step in the QC analysis
                 of HTS data. Along with comprehensive single-sample analysis
                 of alignment data, it includes new modes that allow
                 simultaneous processing and comparison of multiple samples. As
                 with the first version, the new features are available via
                 both graphical and command line interface. Additionally, it
                 includes a large number of improvements proposed by the user

                 web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that
                 are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies.
                 Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex
                 questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This
                 article introduces a new software suite for the comparison,
                 manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser

                 BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments
                 in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are
                 extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large
                 datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both

                   of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For

                 implemented a simple script-like programming language with a
                 clean and minimalist syntax to develop and manage pipeline
                 execution and provide robustness to various types of software
                 and hardware failures as well as portability. RESULTS: We
                 introduce the BigDataScript (BDS) programming language for
                 data processing pipelines, which improves abstraction from
                 hardware resources and assists with robustness. Hardware
                 abstraction allows BDS pipelines to run without modification
                 on a wide range of computer architectures, from a small laptop
                 to multi-core servers, server farms, clusters and clouds. BDS
                 achieves robustness by incorporating the concepts of absolute
                 serialization and lazy processing, thus allowing pipelines to
                 recover from errors. By abstracting pipeline concepts at
                 programming language level, BDS simplifies implementation,

                 based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the

                 mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or
                 each gene. The process of counting reads is called read
                 summarization. Read summarization is required for a great
                 variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively

                 sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly
                 efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques.
                 It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order

                 clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
                 aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
                 human genome 550 million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per
                 hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time
                 improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to
                 unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
                 discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
                 transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
                 sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription
                 polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally
                 validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
                 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the
                 STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR
                 is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open

  abstract = "Driver somatic mutations are a hallmark of a tumor that can be
              used for diagnosis and targeted therapy. Mutations are primarily
              detected from tumor DNA. As dynamic molecules of gene activities,
              transcriptome profiling by RNA sequence (RNA-seq) is becoming
              increasingly popular, which not only measures gene expression but
              also structural variations such as mutations and fusion
              transcripts. Although single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) can be
              easily identified from RNA-seq, intermediate long
              insertions/deletions (indels > 2 bases and less than sequence
              reads) cause significant challenges and are ignored by most
              RNA-seq analysis tools. This study evaluates commonly used
              RNA-seq analysis programs along with variant and somatic mutation
              callers in a series of data sets with simulated and known indels.
              The aim is to develop strategies for accurate indel detection.
              Our results show that the RNA-seq alignment is the most important
              step for indel identification and the evaluated programs have a
              wide range of sensitivity to map sequence reads with indels, from
              not at all to decently sensitive. The sensitivity is impacted by
              sequence read lengths. Most variant calling programs rely on hard
              evidence indels marked in the alignment and the programs with
              realignment may use soft-clipped reads for indel inferencing.
              Based on the observations, we have provided practical
              recommendations for indel detection when different RNA-seq
              aligners are used and demonstrated the best option with highly
              reliable results. With careful customization of bioinformatics
              algorithms, RNA-seq can be reliably used for both SNV and indel
              mutation detection that can be used for clinical decision-making.",
