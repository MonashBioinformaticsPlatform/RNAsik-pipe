This directory contains Genome Browser and Blat application binaries built for standalone
command-line use on various supported Linux and UNIX platforms. To determine which set of binaries
to download, type "uname -a" on the command line to display your machine type. In most cases the
usage statement for the application can be viewed by running the binary with no arguments.

Some of these applications are able to connect to UCSC's public MySQL server. Such applications
require an .hg.conf file to be present  in the user's home directory. For more
information and an example .hg.conf file, see:
http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/mysql.html

This directory contains mostly command-line tools. For instructions on how to
install a Genome Browser web server locally, see:
http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/mirror.html
The directory external.<machine type> contains binaries from third-party
projects that are required for some features of the genome browser web server.

The UCSC Genome Browser and Blat software are free for academic, nonprofit, and personal use. A
