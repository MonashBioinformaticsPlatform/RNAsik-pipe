  abstract = "New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for analyzing
              read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method estimates
              the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a
              precision weight for each observation and enters these into the
              limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for
              RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for
              microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well
              or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are
              generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods.

                 a reference genome. In many applications, the key information
                 required for downstream analysis is the number of reads
                 mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or
                 each gene. The process of counting reads is called read
                 summarization. Read summarization is required for a great
                 variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively
                 little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present
                 featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for
                 counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA
                 sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly
                 efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques.
                 It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order
                 of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far
                 less computer memory. It works with either single or
                 paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options
                 appropriate for different sequencing applications.

                 is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
                 non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
                 lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
                 technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
                 high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
                 limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large
                 (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
                 developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference
                 (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq
                 alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed
                 search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed
                 clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
                 aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
                 human genome 550 million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per
                 hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time
                 improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to
                 unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
                 discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
                 transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
                 sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription
                 polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally
                 validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
                 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the
                 STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR
                 is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open
