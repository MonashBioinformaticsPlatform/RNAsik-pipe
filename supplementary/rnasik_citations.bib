               tools capable of performing this task are available, either for

               RESULTS: Qualimap 2 represents a next step in the QC analysis of
               HTS data. Along with comprehensive single-sample analysis of
               alignment data, it includes new modes that allow simultaneous
               processing and comparison of multiple samples. As with the first
               version, the new features are available via both graphical and

              genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
              However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
              web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are
              routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and
              flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of
              these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This article
              introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation
              and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data
              (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also
              supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to
              both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and
              allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation
              sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation
              tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with
              standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks

              requires complex processing pipelines that run for a long time on
              large computational infrastructures. We designed and implemented
              a simple script-like programming language with a clean and
              minimalist syntax to develop and manage pipeline execution and
              provide robustness to various types of software and hardware

              BigDataScript (BDS) programming language for data processing
              pipelines, which improves abstraction from hardware resources and
              assists with robustness. Hardware abstraction allows BDS
              pipelines to run without modification on a wide range of computer
              architectures, from a small laptop to multi-core servers, server
              farms, clusters and clouds. BDS achieves robustness by
              incorporating the concepts of absolute serialization and lazy

              abstracting pipeline concepts at programming language level, BDS

  abstract = "HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of

              RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based
              on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM)
              index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
              whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local
              FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's
              hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM
              indexes, each representing a genomic region of âˆ¼64,000 bp. Tests

              millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a
              reference genome. In many applications, the key information
              required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping
              to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.
              The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
              summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is
              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR
