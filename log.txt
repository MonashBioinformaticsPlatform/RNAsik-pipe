# version 1.4.5

## 2016.12.19

- fixed samplesSheet parser. Instead using `indexOf()` to search for a pattern now use `startsWith()`. Also do `baseName()` on file path, which is the right thing to do. 
- included star index files as a list of file which are dependencies for indexing step as an ouput files and as input file in star mapping
- added new logging line to log all Fastq file found in the directory
- found couple of bugs in sikPrePro.bds and sikExonicRate.bds, both to do with dependencies, all fixed now
- trying out `canFail := true` option inside a task to enable graceful exit. Should include that statement in number of non essential tasks
- fixed sik.config
