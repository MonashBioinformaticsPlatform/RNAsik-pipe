# RNAsik? yep!

## Getting help

There is an open [RNAsik user's google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rnasik) any can ask and answer
questions there. I will try my best to respond to any questions there, but bear in mind that I could get saturated with work
and might not be able to respond straight away.

Also couple of house keeping things:

- be polite (in general) and considerate of others.
- Include as much information about your problem as you can.
The problem needs to be reproducible, otherwise I might not be able to help you.

p.s any feedback and suggestions are also welcomed there

## Bug reports

Best place to submit bugs is with [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MonashBioinformaticsPlatform/RNAsik-pipe/issues)
Try to include as much information as you can and again problem needs to be reproducible. Sometimes problem could be 
BigDataScript specific so also try looking at [BigDataScrip user's group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigdatascript-users)
