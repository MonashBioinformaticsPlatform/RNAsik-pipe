- included support for `hista2 `aligner
- added samplesSheep logging
- fixed few minor bugs and improved code quality
- added `canFail` option to several non crucial tasks, allowing pipeline to continue if some task failed of fastqc and qualimap to allow them to fail as those are non essential tasks.

# New in version 1.4.7 

- fixed STAR memory allocation issue, now user can run with fewer cpus without a worry for STAR spawning multiple tasks causing out of memory issue.
